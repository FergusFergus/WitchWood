    "doesn’t leave much to be desired, but if I had qualms with the most " +

    "\n(Though the book was published decades ago, I would still expect " +
    "its information to be accurate. There’s ample evidence that ley lines" +
    " move, but at a speed comparable to tectonic plates. The atlas would " +
    "presumably be usable for a few millennia.)",
    "footnote4" : "While not among the most dangerous, ghouls are generally agreed to be one of the more distasteful monsters one may have the misfortune of meeting. The honor is owed to their hunting methods; they are capable of causing immediate tissue death upon physical contact with their victims. The ability extends, to a lesser degree, to its bodily fluids and deceased remains, making cleanup a rather annoying and arduous task. If there are any fortunate qualities one might ascribe to ghouls, they are that ghouls are blessedly uncommon and that unlike most natural necrosis, necrosis from ghoul magic is not caused by bacterial infection. There is therefore no immediate concern for blood poisoning, although the afflicted area must still be removed as soon as possible. Dead tissue quickly becomes a prolific breeding ground for bacteria either way. But as long as the site of necrosis is dealt with promptly, the resulting wound may be treated as any normal injury.",
    "footnote5" : "According to <em>An Encyclopedia of Apotropaic Magic</em>, wards fall into one of two classes: active and passive. (The book is largely the author’s attempt to organize the broad field of protection magic into neat categories. I found it often harmfully reductive, but this particular classification for wards, I consider useful). Active wards require, as the name implies, an active source of mana upon each use. Said mana can be supplied upon the creation of the ward, stored internally like electricity inside a battery. Or, the ward can be made to draw mana from the user when needed." +
    "\nI find the former far easier to make, although in this particular instance I wish I’d gone through the trouble of making the latter. The last of my wards burned away right as the thing finally died, or died as much as ghouls can die. I was very lucky it had let go of me by then. As it were, only a small amount of its blood got on me thus unprotected, and the necrosis didn’t penetrate past my skin. In the end the injury was honestly quite trivial once treated, but I’m always displeased any time I end up having to perform surgery on myself."
