                <h1>Welcome to MageReddit!</h1>
                <p>Hello there! You've been granted access to one of the largest underworld forums on the web. Originally this site was created for and by mages seeking colaboration on arcane inquiries (hence the title), but since then our userbase has expanded to include much of the non-mage underworld. So mage, mundane, or other, we hope you find a community here.</p>
                <p>If you are new to the underworld, then please allow us to extend our warmest welcomes and, if applicable, our condolences. We recommend checking out our handbook to all things supernatural <fakelink><u>here</u></fakelink> (written by <fakelink>@<u>bluish</u></fakelink>). Mages, you might appreciate our introductory guide to magic <fakelink><u>here</u></fakelink> (written by our <fakelink>@<u>Haven34</u></fakelink>). If you find you still have questions, or you want to meet other newcomers, then take a look at the forum <fakelink><u>sr/noobs</u></fakelink>.</p>
                <p>Please take the time to familiarize yourself with our rules <fakelink><u>here</u></fakelink> before posting.</p>

                <h3><u><b>Some General Notes on Posting:</b></u></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Please post in the forum appropriate to your topic. Some forums will admittedly have a more laid-back atmosphere, but remember this site was originally created as a <em>resource</em>. Keep the funny stuff where it belongs so people can find what they need. Threads started in inappropriate forums will be moved or deleted at our discretion.</li>
                    <li>Please note that some forums have their own additional rules regarding posting. Please read them before you post in those forums.</li>
                    <li>Classifieds ads go in the Classifieds. If a post has a Dealer Name, Item and Price, it will be considered a classifieds ad and will be edited accordingly. Please do NOT post classifieds ads (or links to classifieds ads) in any other section of the forum. It will be moderated accordingly.</li>
                    <li>If you have any questions regarding posting, please feel free to PM or Email an Admin or Moderator.</li>
